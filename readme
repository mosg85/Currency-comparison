Your little brother wants to learn by heart different currencies, so you want to create a game for him. The game is to read two countries and print true if those countries have the same currency and false if the currencies are different in these countries, or there is no information about at least one of them.

To create this game, you need to write a special dictionary with the following countries and currencies:

Country	Currency
Germany	Euro
Mali	CFA franc
Dominica	Eastern Caribbean dollar
Canada	Canadian dollar
Spain	Euro
Australia	Australian dollar
Brazil	Brazilian real
Senegal	CFA franc
France	Euro

Note that the names of the countries are to start with a capital letter!
